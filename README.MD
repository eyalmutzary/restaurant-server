## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app locally.

### `npm test`

Runs the app unit & integration tests.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app on development mode, will restart while any changes being saved in the IDE.

## ENV

I have included the environment file (.env) locally for easier running the server, in a production case I would split the env file to X environments while the production details will be stored only on the production host.

## Hosting

I have hosted the server on my Heroku account, you can use all the APIs on production mode while pointing API address to:

### `https://av-server.herokuapp.com/`
